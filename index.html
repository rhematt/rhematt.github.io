	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Dr Richard Matthews</span> and do forensic and systems engineering research.</p>
		
	<p>I get by as a <span itemprop="title">father</span>, <span itemprop="title">engineer</span>, and <span itemprop="title">forensic scientist</span>, living in <span itemprop="address" itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Address"><span itemprop="region">South Australia</span></span> and working for the <a href="https://ecms.adelaide.edu.au/electrical-electronic-engineering/">School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering</a> at <span itemprop="affiliation">the <a href="http://www.adelaide.edu,au">University of Adelaide</a></span>.</p>
		
	<p> I'm a straight shooter and tell it like it is. Pedophilia, human trafficking and abuse inflicted against children are some of the most abhorrent crimes known to our modern society. The technological revolution that was ushered in with the internet disrupted all industries, including our ability to combat this filth. During my MBA at the Unviersity of Adelaide I was opened up to the concept of ensuring our skill sets were being used to solve the right problems faced within our modern world. That's why in my work I continue building towards systems that will automatically detect, filter and disrupt online abuse in all its forms. Unlike other computer scientists, my take on this work is unqiue. I ensure my tools are built with the forensic process in mind ensuring that not only is abhorent media eliminated from our networks, but evidence of the crime is preserved leading to successful prosecution. However, breaking a single link is not enough. To completely eradicate this problem measures need to be taken to disrupt the supply chain at all levels. My work focuses on the detection, moderation, classification and storage of online abuse material. It further focuses on the analysis, categorisation, linkage and provenance of that material. Finally, through international and interdisciplinary collaborations the human, psychological and criminological elements of these challenges become known leading to victimcentric reforms, educational programs and cultural changes to eliminate the socioeconomic factors leading to environments which cater to online abuse. </p> 
		
	<p>I'm also available for hire as a <span itemprop="title">forensic consultant</span> and <span itemprop="title">expert witness</span>. <a href="contact">Drop me a line</a> about your project if you're interested in working with me.</p> 
		
	<p>My main motivation has been and always will be as described above. However, I am a strong advocate for digital forensic evidence which is admissable and used correctly. I know the realities of bias and incorrect workflows which plauge our current system. If you have an accused client I am happy to look at the digital evidence to ensure due process has been followed and correct inferences have been made. </p>
