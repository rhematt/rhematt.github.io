    "description": "As the Founder and CEO of RHEM Labs, I lead the development of AI-driven forensic and legal automation solutions, integrating Generative AI, digital forensics, and cloud platforms (Google Cloud & Microsoft Azure) to enhance accessibility and forensic investigations. With a PhD in Digital Forensics and expertise in Responsible AI, my work focuses on advancing AI-powered forensic analysis, streamlining digital disclosure, evidence processing, and expert reporting.\n\nI lead the design and deployment of LoganAI, an AI-powered forensic and legal automation platform that leverages LLMs (Large Language Models), secure cloud computing, and digital forensic methodologies to support expert witnesses, forensic analysts, and legal professionals. These solutions enable automated case analysis, forensic triage, and AI-assisted document generation while ensuring compliance with legal evidentiary standards.\n\nKey contributions include:\n- Development of AI-assisted forensic automation techniques to enhance eDiscovery, case assessment, and evidence processing.\n- Deployment of secure forensic AI systems on Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud to ensure compliance, scalability, and data security.\n- Integration of AI models for forensic analysis and document synthesis to support expert witness preparation.\n- Advocacy for Responsible AI in forensic and legal applications, ensuring AI-assisted methods align with ethical and legal frameworks.\n\nThrough RHEM Labs, I continue to advance AI and cloud computing applications in forensic science, collaborating with legal professionals, forensic experts, and industry stakeholders to drive innovation in expert testimony preparation and digital investigations.",

During this time, I developed a novel framework to test the accuracy, precision, and performance of commercial off-the-shelf technologies involved in 3D imaging. This pipeline visualization was presented to the Forensic Capability Network's 3D Experts Group, Research Festival, and the INTERPOL Digital Forensic Experts Group.\n\nI also explored the impacts of Snapchat as a source of open-source intelligence. Through this research, a fatal error in the Snapchat platform was discovered which resulted in a significant security issue. This issue could lead to the identification of individual users and the subsequent ability to track them via their postings onto the Snapchat platform. It was responsibly and ethically disclosed to Snap Inc. and awarded a bug bounty as well as researcher thanks.",

However, due to travel restrictions imposed by the global COVID-19 pandemic, the research was undertaken as a subcontractor in my home nation. Through this collaboration, I developed a framework to assess the relevant technological risk posed by generative adversarial networks to an emerging intelligence field known as cyber intelligence. In this work, we assisted in defining what cyber intelligence is, investigated different applications of generative adversarial networks within the cyber intelligence domain, and determined the framework to assess them. The work was published in the CCDCOE's internal library.",
