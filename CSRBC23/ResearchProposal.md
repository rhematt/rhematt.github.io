<h1> Research Proposal </h1>

During the boot camp, you can work collaboratively on a research project. This project may be a current research project, interest or something completely different. One of the benefits of the program is working with other international participants on common research themes. To this end, you are encouraged to collaborate and draw similar projects with other participants.

To help you conceptualise ideas, you have already presented your current research expertise and research interests. Now it is time to combine those interests and formalise some projects together.

The following template is based on the Adelaide Graduate Research School "Admission Research Proposal Template For Higher Degree by Research Applicants", available at [https://www.adelaide.edu.au/graduate-research/ua/media/489/admision-research-proposal-template.pdf](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/graduate-research/ua/media/489/admision-research-proposal-template.pdf). Please use the following questions to structure a research proposal which you will present. 

Please structure your research proposal based on the headings provided below. Use a clear and legible font (e.g. Arial, size 12) and observe the provided limits. A 2,500-word limitation (5 pages) applies, excluding Bibliography/ References. One thousand words are usually sufficient. You will be given feedback on this document from the research supervisors during the next two days.

<h1> Template </h1>

<h2> 1. Project title </h2>
Provide a short descriptive title of at most 20 words.

<h2> 2. Project summary </h2>
Provide a summary of the proposed research project (up to 100 words). The outline has to be intelligible to a reader who is not a specialist in this field.

<h2> 3. Project details </h2>

In this section (200-500 words), you will break your proposal down into the following subheadings:

   <h3> Background </h3>
  Here you will provide any information the reader will require to understand the research problem you wish to introduce.

   <h3> Aims </h3>
  This section will list what your research is trying to achieve. Consider this section an opportunity to start formalising a research hypothesis.

  <h3> Significance </h3>
  In this section, you will include details about why your research matters. For example, what is essential about your hypothesis to the general community or the specific research community your research will impact?

  <h3> Expected Outcomes </h3>
  This area is where you will provide a narrative about the expected results of your research.

<h2> 4. Research materials and methods </h2>
Outline the theoretical frameworks and methods you expect to use in your research (up to 200 words). This section may include a discussion of the sources to be consulted. Research methods do not need to be restricted to technical methods and can consist of a discussion of quantitative or qualitative methods. Provide reference to any materials that you will require. 

<h2> 5. References cited </h2>
Please provide a list of scholarly references cited in the proposal. For the Bootcamp, please consult the
The IEEE Reference Manual (https://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/IEEE-Reference-Guide.pdf) is a Chicago-style Manual of referencing.

<h1> Presentation </h1>

You will present your research proposal as a 10-minute presentation on Wednesday after lunch. To facilitate this, please prepare a presentation of appropriate length covering the above details.

<h1> Review </h1>

There will be opportunities for peer review by a researcher. More details will be provided on Tuesday.
