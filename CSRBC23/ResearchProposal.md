<h1> Research Proposal </h1>

During the bootcamp you have the opportunity to work collaborative on a reseach project. This may be a current research project, interest or something completely different. One of the benefits of the program is working with other international participants on common research themes. To this end you are encouraged to work together and draw parallel projects with other participants.

To help you conceptualise ideas you have already presented your current research expertise and research interests. Now it is time to combine those interests and formalise some projects together.

The following template is based on the Adelaide Graduate Research School "Admission Research Proposal Template For Higher Degree by Research Applicants" avaliable at: [https://www.adelaide.edu.au/graduate-research/ua/media/489/admision-research-proposal-template.pdf](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/graduate-research/ua/media/489/admision-research-proposal-template.pdf). Please use the following questions to strucutre a research proposal which you will present. 

Please structure your research proposal based on the headings provided below. Use a clear and legible font (e.g. Arial, size 12) and observe the provided limits. A 2,500 word limit (5 pages) applies, excluding Bibliography/ References. 1,000 words are normally sufficient. You will be given feedback on this document from the research supervisors on hand during the next two days.

<h1> Template </h1>

<h2> 1. Project title </h2>
Provide a short descriptive title of no more than 20 words.

<h2> 2. Project summary </h2>
Provide a short summary of the proposed research project (up to 100 words). The summary has to be intelligible to a reader who is not a specialist in this field.

<h2> 3. Project details </h2>

In this section (200-500 words) you will break your proposal down into the following sub headings:

   <h3> Background </h3>
  Here you will provide any information the reader will require in order to understand the research problem you wish to introduce.

   <h3> Aims </h3>
  In this section you will list what it is that your research is trying to acheive. This is an opportunity to start formalising a research hypothesis.

  <h3> Significance </h3>
  In this section you will include details about why your research matters. What is important about your hypothesis to the general community or the specific reserach community you research will impact.

  <h3> Expected Outcomes </h3>
  This is where you will provide a narrative about the expected results of your research.

<h2> 4. Research materials and methods </h2>
Outline the theoretical frameworks and methods you expect to use as part of your research (up to 200 words). This section may include a discussion of the sources to be consulted. This is not restricted to technical methods and can include a discussion of quantitative or qualitative methods to be used. Provide reference to any materials that you will require. 

<h2> 5. References cited </h2>
Please provide a list of scholarly references cited in the proposal. For the purposes of the bootcamp, please consult the
IEEE Reference Manual (https://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/IEEE-Reference-Guide.pdf) which is a Chicago style Manual of referencing.

<h1> Presentation </h1>

You will be presenting your research proposal as a 10 minute presentation on Wednesday after lunch. To facilitate this please prepare a presentation of appropriate length covering the above details.

<h1> Review </h1>

There will be opportunities for peer review by a researcher. More details will be provided on Tuesday.
