Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. I'm also stealing this content from [JMCGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) while I follow a tutorial to get it started as I'm sick of the bloat in wordpress, just like they are.
