An example:

"we can't raise minimum wage"

why

"well, small businesses wouldn't beable to afford it."

why

"If the minimum wage was raised, small businesses would have to either hire less staff or increase prices. This would led to more people shopping at the large department stores."

why

"Because people like to go to places which have a larger range of cheaper products at the big brand stores. It's convinient."

why

"Simply because disposible income is at a minimum for many familes, they simply can't afford to shop at the smaller shops. So they like to go to a singular store where they can purchase everything they need under one roof where the prices are the cheapest."

why

"Well I guess it wouldn be because wages are so low and have lost buying power compared to inflation."
