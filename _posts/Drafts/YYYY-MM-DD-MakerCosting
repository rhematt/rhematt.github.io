From a comment made on Facebook regarding pricing of maker work which uses CNC machines.

You shouldn’t be charging full hourly rate for machine work. The cost of recovery should be set to what the wear factor is on the machine.

For example: 
- The machine cost is $6,000. 
- Running 12 hours per day for 5 days a week yields 60 hours per week. 
- This equates to 3,120 hours per annum. 
- You assume a running time of 5 years before the machine will need to be replaced, or bulk maintenance will need to be performed.
- This equates to 15,600 operational hours. 
- If you assume a purchase price of $8,000 then the hourly cost for the machine is 8,000/15,600 = $0.51 per hour.

This is the replacement cost of the machine. Factor in a profit margin which is acceptable for the work you perform. This can be anywhere from 30% - 300% - 3000%. If you assume a conservative 280% an hourly rate for machined work could be in the realm of $1.50 per hour.

So I’d look at pricing: 
2 x hourly wage ($40.50 for a engineer technician in Australia 2022.)
5 x machine hours
1 x material cost

= 2(40) + 2(1.50) + X 
= 80 + 3 + x
~ $80+x

In other words, the machine time isn’t even worth charging.

Charge for setup time, finishing time and materials.

To illustrate the final point, the depreciation of the machine is $3 at a profit margin of 2.8 X. This factor is to recover other overheads that we have not documented.

3/80 = 3.75%

if we ignore the mark up and just allocate the machine cost:
1/80 = 1.25%

Now for larger work, 1-4% of your price should be allocated to machine work. But, for short run, individual or low cost jobs, the machine costs are such that they are pracitcally free.
