# Bridging the Legacy Gap: A Multi-Layer AI Architecture for Integrating COBOL Systems with Modern Tech

PLEASE NOTE: this blog post is still in draft form. It is a skeleton that needs to be properly fleshed out and may change significatly when I get around to finalising it.

In the dynamic world of software, legacy systems are prevalent. Languages such as COBOL, FORTRAN and even underlying machine code stand as monuments to resilience. Despite their age, they form the backbone of critical processes in sectors like government and finance. However, this resilience comes with a cost—diminishing expertise, high migration or modification costs, and the rising challenge of interfacing with modern technologies. As the global knowledge behind these tools continue to age out of the workforce industries have been warned of an impending skills shortage.

*Herein lies the crux of our discussion: could the innovations behind Large Language Models, and the robust translation demonstrations already shown give way to a new multi-layer AI architecture that could bridge this gap?*

COBOL, a half-century-old programming language, continues to underpin significant parts of our digital infrastructure. From banking to healthcare, you would be hard pressed to not find some underlying database that is built upon a legacy system coded in COBOL. Yet, it's a system in twilight, with a dwindling pool of skilled programmers and an increasing disconnect from contemporary technologies. The cost of transitioning away from COBOL, both financially and operationally, is often prohibitive, leading to organisations focusing on the mantra “well if it ain’t broke why fix it?” It’s a delicate impasse.

A theoretical solution we came up with the other day borrows from the principles of systems thinking, leveraging an emerging technology that has not yet gained much attention due to the hype of generative AI; multi-agent systems.

It consists of five layers working in concert:

1. Human Interface Layer: The front-line of user interaction, designed with an emphasis on accessibility and user-friendliness.
2. Primary AI Co-pilot (Logan): Named Logan, this AI agent serves as the 'brain', interpreting user needs and generating high-level commands. It encapsulates Dr. Matthews' vision of interdisciplinary AI solutions.
3. Python Wrapper Layer: Python, with its versatility and readability, forms the bridge between Logan and the next layer, translating high-level commands into more specific instructions.
4. Secondary AI Agent: This agent is a specialist, adept at converting Python instructions into COBOL-compatible operations.
5. Immutable COBOL Code Layer: The existing COBOL system, a testament to the constraints we navigate in this process.

The fragility of legacy systems became glaringly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. The management of unemployment benefits and IRS operations in the U.S. strained under the pressure, starkly illustrating the real-world implications of the COBOL conundrum.

Envision a user needing to retrieve data from the COBOL system. They interact with the Human Interface Layer, which conveys the request to Logan. Logan, understanding the user's needs, formulates a command passed to the Python Wrapper Layer. The Secondary AI Agent translates this command into COBOL operations, which are executed in the Immutable COBOL Code Layer. The retrieved data flows back up through the layers to be presented to the user.

This architecture promises robustness, flexibility, and ease of management, aligning with systems thinking and a multi-disciplinary approach. It's not confined to COBOL; it could serve as a blueprint for integrating any legacy systems with modern technologies.

Bridging the gap between legacy and modern systems is a pressing need. This proposed multi-layer architecture, adaptable and robust, our mission to revolutionize accessibility through AI. By employing multiple AI agents as contextual translation tools in an AI chain, we can circumvent the lack of COBOL knowledge, enabling more efficient and effective interactions with these legacy systems.
