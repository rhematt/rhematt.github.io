## Research Employment
### Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Cyber Intelligence
RHEM Labs\
2020 - 2021\

Working as a subcontractor for the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence this research position would normally have been undertaken as a postdoctoral research position based at the centre. However due to travel restriction impossed due to the global COVID 19 pandemic the research was undertaken as a subcontractor in my home nation. Through this collaboration I developed a framework to assess the relevant technological risk possed by generative adversarial networks to an emerging intelligence field known as cyber intelligence. In this work we assisted in defining what cyber intelligence is, investigated different applications of generative advesarial networks within cyber intelligence domain and determined the framework to assess them. The work was published on the CCDCOE's internal library and is avaliable at the following link. [Generative Adversarial Networks from a Cyber Intelligence Perspective](https://ccdcoe.org/library/publications/generative-adversarial-networks-from-a-cyber-intelligence-perspective/).

### Course Development
Dr Matthews has been involved in the design or redesign of the following courses:

- Design and innovation
	- This core course for between 60 to 120 students introduced the engineering processes of planning, design and innovation, including ethical, social and environmental responsibilities of professional engineers to undergraduates in the electrical and electronic bachelor suite of programs. Topics include; The work of engineers and their outputs; systems engineering concepts; the life cycle of systems; risk, safety and sustainability; the engineering method; design thinking; innovation and creation; managing engineering projects; engineering and business; engineering and society; regulations and social constraints; ethics; working in teams; professional competencies.


- Engineering Technology and Digital Design
	- This core course for 12 to 25 students was designed for the undergraduate level. It provided an introduction to the role of an engineering technologist. It started with the development of technical and professional attributes essential to perform this role effectively. Through participation in the learning activities, students developed interpersonal communication and professional skills. Hands on experience with a modern digital design software suite commensurate with defence industry practices was also included. This course was delivered in a mixed mode, with intensive lectures complemented by workshops throughout the semester. Assessments were a mixture of assignments, presentations and lab exercises. Half way through this course the teaching was converted to online only due to the covid 19 pandemic.
	

- 3D Print Prototyping
	- This course for 15 to 30 students was taught at an undergraduate and postgraduate level. It was designed to introduce students to a basic overview of additive manufacturing technologies and the prototyping options available to them. This course gave students a firm grasp of modelling in 3D as well as providing the basis for the moral, ethical and legal arguments that are currently facing the 3D printing world. Finally, students were introduced to the advances that are to be expected in the next five to ten years and the opportunities that await in the areas of bioprinting.


- Introduction to Programming for IT Professionals
	- This course was designed for students with no prior programming experience, who are enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Technology. Each cohort was between 60 to 120 students. The course introduced the fundamental concepts of procedural programming, with a focus on approaches to programming relevant for IT, including scripting languages. Topics included algorithms and problem solving, data types, control structures, functions, arrays, files, and the mechanics of running, testing, and debugging. The course also offers an introduction to the ethical, historical and social context of computing.
