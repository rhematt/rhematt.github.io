### Researcher in Digital Forensics (Casual)

University of Adelaide\
2020 - current

Working with Dr Matthew Sorell, I explored the forensic applications of 3D imaging methods. During this time I devloped a novel framework to test the accuracy, precision and preformance of commercial off the shelf technologies involved in 3D imaging. This pipeline visualisation was presented to the Forensic Capability Networks 3D Experts Group, Research Festival and the INTERPOL Digital Forensic Experts Group.

I also explored the impacts of Snapchat as a source of open source intelligence. Thorugh this research, a fatal error in the Snapchat platform was discovered which resulted in a signficiant security issue. This issue could lead to the identification of individual users and subsequent ability to track them via their postings onto the Snapchat platform. It was responsibily and ethically disclosed to Snap inc. and awarded a bug bounty as well as researcher thanks.

### Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Cyber Intelligence

RHEM Labs\
2020 - 2021

Working as a subcontractor for the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence this research position would normally have been undertaken as a postdoctoral research position based at the centre. However due to travel restriction impossed due to the global COVID 19 pandemic the research was undertaken as a subcontractor in my home nation. Through this collaboration I developed a framework to assess the relevant technological risk possed by generative adversarial networks to an emerging intelligence field known as cyber intelligence. In this work we assisted in defining what cyber intelligence is, investigated different applications of generative advesarial networks within cyber intelligence domain and determined the framework to assess them. The work was published on the CCDCOE's internal library.

### Postdoctoral Researcher in Cybersecurity

University of Adelaide\
2019-2020

Reporting to Dr Matthew Sorell and Dr Braden Philips I was responsible for conducting an independent study on the cybersecurity of small form satellites as used in a military context. This position was supported by a grant from the Defence Science and Technology Group. Further details Available upon request.

 ## <a name="ResearchMotivation"></a> Research Motivation

My research interests are primarily focused in the discipline of the Forensic Sciences. My current focus is towards forensic validation generally, digital and media forensics specifically and the nature of science philosophically. I have strong interests in all types of media including visual and audio and apply this to current and emerging issues within cyber security, intelligence and forensic science.

During my MBA at the Unviersity of Adelaide I was introduced to the concept of ensuring our skills were employed solving the right problems faced within our modern world. Pedophilia, human trafficking and abuse inflicted against children are some of the most abhorrent crimes known to our modern society. The technological revolution that was ushered in with the internet disrupted all industries, including our ability to combat these vile crimes. In my work I continue building towards systems that will automatically detect, filter and disrupt online abuse in all its forms.

My take on this work is unique due to the integration of systems thinking. I ensure my tools are built with the forensic process in mind ensuring that not only is abhorent media eliminated from our networks, but evidence of the crime is preserved leading to successful prosecution. However, breaking a single link is not enough. To completely eradicate the problem of online abuse and human trafficking measures need to be taken to disrupt the system at all possible intervention points. On one hand, my work focuses on the detection, moderation, classification and storage of online abuse material. On another, it studies the methods of analysis, categorisation, linkage and provenance of online abuse and surviellance material. Through the integration of systems thinking these tools create leverge to disrupt at the critical point of dissemination and creation. Such disruption leads to a greater ability in locating those who are victims to these crimes.

I acknowldege that my own work is not enough to solve the issues recognised by the systems level analysis of the problem. Recognising the limitations technology has, through international and interdisciplinary collaborations the human, psychological and criminological elements of these challenges become clear leading to victimcentric reforms, educational programs and cultural changes to eliminate the socioeconomic factors leading to environments which cater to online abuse.

  - SnapScraper is an open source intelligence tool which enables users to download media uploaded to Snapchat’s Snap Map using a set of latitude and longitiude co-ordinates.
  - I developed this application in Swift in 2020.
  - This project led to a honours project for 3 students in 2021 at the University of Adelaide to expand upon the functionality for automatically moderating the content uploaded to social media networks using convolutional networks.
  - A decision was made to release this innovation under an MIT licence rather than pursue a patent due to the application space for the law enforcement and intelligence community at large.

### <a name="AcademicAppointments"></a>Academic Appointments

**2021 - current, Lecturer (Casual), University of Adelaide.**

Working under Dr Matthew Sorell, I was responsible for the course co-ordination and teaching of 60 students completing Design and Innovation. This course looks to teach students further professional practice skills including writing, presentation and consulting skills needed for job ready graduates. Assessment includes the use of two essays, a semester long group project and an innovative peer assessment which enabled the full participation of all students in group work. This caused the assessment of previous years to change from weighted HD and Ds to Ds and Cs reflecting a better practice in line with school expectations. This course was revised to be taught in a blended mode this year due to COVID 19. I was responsible for teaching the online lectures and workshops while the teaching load was shared with a fellow member of the teaching staff who taught an additional workshop person.

**2020 - 2021, Lecturer (fixed term), University of Adelaide.**

During first semester of 2020 I was given a fixed term position. Working with Dr’s Bree Bennett, David Harvey and Brian Ng I was responsible for the design and teaching of a new first year course covering the introduction of engineering drawing, CAD and technical design to Engineering Technologists as part of the course Engineering Technology and Digital Design. Students in this class were required to complete a variety of assessment including the design of 3D models, engineering drawings and online quizzes. This course was designed to be taught primarily online due to COVID 19.

**2020 - 2021, Lecturer (Casual), University of Adelaide.**

During the Australian summer of 2020 I worked with Professor Nickolas Falkner, the course Introduction to Programming for Information Technology Specialists was completely redesigned to utilise Jupyter notebooks for assessment. The language taught was also completely change to Python with all material redesigned with slides recreated and material earmarked for new recordings.

Working under Dr Matthew Sorell in semester 2 of 2020, I was given the responsiblity as the course co-ordinator, teaching 80 students completing Design and Innovation. This course looks to teach students further professional practice skills including writing, presentation and consulting skills needed for job ready graduates. Assessment included the use of two essays, a semester long group project and an innovative peer assessment which enabled the full participation of all students in group work. This caused the assessment of previous years to change from weighted HD and Ds to Ds and Cs reflecting a better practice. This course was designed to be taught primarily online due to COVID 19.

**2019 - 2020, Tutor (Casual), University of Adelaide.**

Reporting to Dr Braden Philips, I was responsible for running and coordinating the ECMS learning service for the combined first-year subject Digital Systems and Analog Electronics. This service was a drop-in style peer-assisted study session run twice each week and assisted on average five students each session with any tutorial, practical and homework problems throughout the semester.

**2018-2019, Lecturer (Casual), University of Adelaide**

In Trimester 3 of 2018, I ran the course teaching 3D Print Prototyping to Entrepreneurship students. This subject was taught in intensive mode and was by my design, having written it in the preceding summer. The course covers the essential operation of a 3D printer along with other 3D technologies such as laser cutters, computer numeric controlled machines and the basics of formulating a small business to match a product to be successfully manufactured using such a tool.

**2016 - 2019, Practical Demonstrator (Casual), University of Adelaide.**

Reporting to Dr Hong Gunn Chew, I was responsible for the primary supervision and management of up to 90 students for first-year electrical and electronic engineering practical sessions. I ran the demonstrations and guided the students through their assignment. I was assisted by another junior demonstrator and would manage their participation and lead them in what would need to be done on any one day to maintain the class best.

**2015 - 2016, Tutor (Casual), University of Adelaide.**

Reporting to Dr Matthew Sorell, I conducted tutorials for the first year electrical and electronic engineering subject EEIB. In addition to the tutorials I also supervised mid semester quizzes, did marking and also supervised a replacement exam.

### <a name="CourseDevelopment"></a>Course Development

Dr Matthews has been involved in the development of courses for small and large cohorts including those aimed at introductory, intermediate and advance levels. This includes the design or redesign of the following courses at the University of Adelaide:

### <a name="ResearchSupervision"></a> Research supervision

**2020 - current, masters supervisor (volunteer), Tallin University of Technology.**

I have assisted in the supervision and peer review of masters students at the Tallin University of Technology as an external co-supervisor since 2020. These students undertake a traditional thesis and viva. I have been involved in the review and marking of viva and thesis.

**2018 - current, honours supervisor (volunteer), University of Adelaide.**

I have supervised 12 honours students since 2017 as part of a supervison group with Dr Matthew Sorell.

In 2021, I was primary supervisor for a team of three students completing their honours engineering project of my design. The project involved a further look at the Snap Scraper I developed and the integration of machine learning techniques using a systems engineering approach to create a system capable of scraping content from Snapchat, automatically classify and then store in a database which would meet the requirements of a forensic workflow.

In 2019, I was primary supervisor for a team of two students exploring the forensic applications of 3D imaging through a grant obtained from the National Institute of Forensic Sciences. This work has gone on to form part of my ongoing work in 3D imaging which has been presented internationally as part of the INTERPOL digital experts group and the UK's Forensic Capability Network's 3D Experts group. In each case my students have been given credit for the work they have performed.

In 2018, I was co-supervisor to seven students across three teams each exploring different applications of cybersecurity as it related to children's safety watches. This work led to the Australian recall of certain devices for not meeting standards.

Each year, excluding 2020 and 2021, As part of the honours supervision process I was responsible for teaching 20 students from Germany, Estonia and The University of Adelaide the basics in research methods including how to reference, use LaTeX, BibTex, and Microsoft Word to write scholarship, present 3-minute thesis and prepare research abstracts. This program was aimed at commencing honours, masters and doctoral students. The honours supervision lasted all year and included the assessment of honours thesis, group seminar presentations, and assisting students in drafting publications for conferences. While this was disrupted by the global pandemic the intent of the program has remained.

**2020 - 2020, Summer Research Scholarship Supervisor (volunteer), University of Adelaide.**

During Semester 2 of 2020 I supervised a summer research scholarship holder who completed a program of enquiry into the automatic categorisation and moderation of short form videos. 10 second videos were obtained from Snapchat and provided to several different machine learning engines to detect videos taken while behind the the seat of a steering wheel. The motivation was to detect people using their camera phone while driving.
